# FeedSage

**FeedSage** is a personalized YouTube feed detoxification platform that filters out distracting or irrelevant content. It uses a custom Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to serve only goal-oriented video recommendations based on the user’s intent and interests.

This platform is built using Next.js and TypeScript, with Gemini API for semantic analysis and Astra DB as the vector database for fast and accurate retrieval.

## Features

FeedSage offers personalized recommendations aligned with user-defined topics. It bypasses YouTube’s native recommendation engine to provide a curated, focused experience. It includes AI-based context filtering, a clean and responsive UI, and scalable architecture for future integrations.

## Tech Stack

The project is built using Next.js for the frontend and server-side logic, TypeScript for type safety, Tailwind CSS for styling, Gemini API for language understanding, and Astra DB for vector search capabilities.
